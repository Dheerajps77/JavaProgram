Iterator

Iterator is the interface and found in the java.util package.
It has three methods

*hasNext()
*next()
*remove()

Enumeration

Enumeration is also an interface and found in the java.util package .
It is used for passing through a collection, usually of unknown size.

It has following methods

*hasMoreElements()
*nextElement()

Note : Enumeration does not have remove() method.

Difference between Iterator and Enumeration: 

1. Remove() method :  The major difference between Iterator and Enumeration is that Iterator has the remove() method while Enumeration does not have remove() method.
Enumeration interface acts as a read only interface, one can not do any modifications to Collection while traversing the elements of the Collection. 
Iterator can do modifications (e.g using remove() method it removes the element from the Collection during traversal).  
Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics.
Enumeration is used for read only access while Iterator is useful to manipulate the list.
2. Addition to JDK : Enumeration is added to the jdk1.0 version while Iterator is added in jdk1.2 version.

3. Fail-fast or Fail-safe : Enumeration is fail-safe in nature. It does not throw ConcurrentModificationException if Collection is modified during the traversal.
Iterator is fail-fast in nature. It throws ConcurrentModificationException if a Collection is modified while iterating other than its own remove() method. I have already shared the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators in java.

4. Legacy :  Enumeration is a legacy interface which is used for traversing Vector, Hashtable. 
Iterator is not a legacy interface. Iterator can be used for the traversal of HashMap, LinkedList,  ArrayList, HashSet, TreeMap, TreeSet . 

5. Preference :  According to Oracle docs,

The functionality of Enumeration  is duplicated by the iterator interface.Iterator adds an optional remove operation,and has shorter method names. New implementations should consider using Iterator in preference to Enumeration. 

Similarities between Iterator and Enumeration in Java

1. Interface :Both Iterator and Enumeration are interfaces.

2. Package : Both Iterator and Enumeration are present in java.util package.


Enumeration
1. Using Enumeration, you can only traverse the collection. You can’t do any modifications to collection while traversing it.
2. Enumeration is introduced in JDK 1.0
3. Enumeration is used to traverse the legacy classes like Vector, Stack and HashTable.
4. Methods : hasMoreElements() and nextElement()	
5. Enumeration is fail-safe in nature.
6. Enumeration is not safe and secured due to it’s fail-safe nature.

Iterator
1. Using Iterator, you can remove an element of the collection while traversing it.
2. Iterator is introduced from JDK 1.2
3. Iterator is used to iterate most of the classes in the collection framework like ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, LinkedList etc.
4. Methods : hasNext(), next() and remove()
5. Iterator is fail-fast in nature.
6. Iterator is safer and secured than Enumeration.
