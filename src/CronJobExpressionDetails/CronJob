Jenkins : Scheduling Jenkins Jobs for a specific time
Jenkins uses a cron expression, the different fields are :

MINUTES Minutes in one hour (0-59)
HOURS Hours in one day (0-23)
DAYMONTH Day in a month (1-31)
MONTH Month in a year (1-12)
DAYWEEK Day of the week (0-7) where 0 and 7 are sunday
Since a few versions, Jenkins add a new parameter, H : (extract from the jenkins code documentation)

Example 1 : H H(3-4) * * *  : A job which runs every Day of the week, every Month in a year , 
every Day in a month at a time between 3 – 4 am in the morning at any minute.

Example 2 : H (30 -45) 3 * * * : A job which runs every Day of the week, every Month in a year , 
every Day in a month at 3 am in the morning between 30 -45 minutes.

Example 3 : */5 * * * * : If you want to shedule your build every 5 minutes, this will do the job

Example 4 : 0 8 * * * : schedule your build every day at 8h 00, this will do the job
