A POJO must not :

1.) Extend pre-specified classes: 
			Ex- public class Test extends javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet is not considered to be a POJO class.
2.) Contain pre-specified annotations: 
			Ex- @javax.persistence.Entity public class Test{..} is not a pojo class.
3.) Implement prespecified interfaces: 
			Ex- public class Test implements javax.ejb.EntityBean { … } is not considered to be a POJO class.
